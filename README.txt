== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have never seen Airplane! Will I find this plugin funny? =

First of all, you need to see Airplane! It is a movie considered by critics to be one of the greatest movies of all time. Many would postulate that it is better than The Godfather.

= Really? Better than The Godfather? =

Yes, really. And don't question me again.

= I heard there is a sequel. Is it any good? =

It is hilarious. Much better than anything Steven Spielberg or Martin Scorcese could ever create.

= I just watched the movie and I didn't think it was that great. =

You are an idiot.

= Is there anything factually incorrect about the movie? =

 At the real airport, the white zone is for loading and unloading of passengers only, and there's no stopping in the red zone (except for transit buses).

= Surely, that can't be true. =

It is true, and don't call me Shirley.
